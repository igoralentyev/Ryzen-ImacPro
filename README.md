# Ryzen-ImacPro
OpenCore EFI for running macos  on 2600x + asus prime x-370a + rx570 Sapphire

# Guide
Use this as is if you know what are you doing, or go through awesome Dortania's guide - https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/

This efi runs perfect on OpenCore 0.6.1 with Catalina 10.15.6

Note, if your install stuck with gray window with infinity preloader icon after final rebooting before Mac setup - just try to reload your PC, it's worked in my case
